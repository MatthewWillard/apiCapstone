Summary:  Right now this is a simple API app that returns events from the area you search.  Currently you can only search for musical or sport events.  The results include a name of the event, the time and day, the address, and a link for more information.  It was suggested to put the search function on the loading pages and a selection on what to search for(i.e. sports or music), but I set it up this way so it's easier to add more searchs from differant APIs at a later time.  Ideas for a later addition include weather, restaurants, or any other API that would help plan a night out.  

Technologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery
